**good research needs**
1. good sample (representative of population)
2. sample size
3. good study method

**Constructs vs operational definition**

Constructs are things that are abstract, and hard to define and measure eg. effort, age, itchiness, hunger.

Operational definitions are things that are easily measured

Double Blind Control Trial is gold standard of doing research.

**Sample Population**

**Correlation vs Causation**
-correlation doesn’t equal causation

**Survey(pros)**
* easy to get info on population
* relative inexpensive
* conducted remote
* anyone can access and analyze survey
Survey(cons)
* bias
* non-response bias
* not understanding question (response bias)
* untruthful
Placebo and Double Blind
* reduce bias of participants and researchers

**Random Assignment**
* randomization allows the control group and intervention group to be similar, reduces bias
Parameter vs Statistics
* parameter is a number that describes a population
* statistic is a number that describes a sample

**Sample error**
* the difference between a sample and population

Lurking Variable = Extraneous Variable

**Histogram vs Bar gram**
* Bar graph shows distinct categories, categorical/quality on x axis
* Histogram x axis has quantitive data/continuous data
* only histogram can change bin size

**Positive Skewed vs Negative Skewed**

**Mode, Median, Average**
* mode: local maximum
* median: most frequent, not affected by outlier
* average: average of all data, outlier can affect average

**Mean and its properties**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_4.png)

* all scores in distribution affect the mean
* the mean can be describe with a formula
* many samples from the same population will have similar means
* the means of a sample can be used to make inferences about the population it came from
* the mean will not change if an extreme value becomes part of dataset

**Median**
* Median is robust, because it is not affected by outliers.

**median for n even number:**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_9.png)

```
\frac
{{X_{\frac{n}{2}}}+{X_{{\frac{n}{2}}+{1}}}}
{2} 
```

median for n odd number:

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_6.png)


```
\#Latex

X_{\frac{n+1}{2}}
```


**Mode vs median vs mean**
* median is always in the middle
* mode is always the most frequent occurring score, there is no mode if no value occurred twice
* mean is affected by outliers, but median and mode are not

Range = max score - min score

Q1, Q2, Q3

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_5.png)

* interquartile range = q3-q1

**Outlier**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_10.png)

**BOX PLOTS**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_7.png)

* dot represents outliers

**Average Deviation：**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_11.png)

\frac
{\sum{X_i-\overline{X}}}
{n}

**Variance**
* sum of squares (SS) divided by n

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_2.png)

\frac
{\sum{(X_i-\overline{X})}^2}
{n}

**Standard Deviation**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_3.png)

\sqrt
{
\frac
{\sum{(X_i-\overline{X})}^2}
{n}
}

* for a normal distribution, 68% of data falls within 1 SD
* for a normal distribution, 95% of data falls within 2 SD

**Bessel’s Correction for standard deviation**

![](Descriptive%20Statistics/image_13.png)

* Bessel’s correction make standard deviation a little bigger.
